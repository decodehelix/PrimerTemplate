# PrimerTemplate 

This repo have two files Mispriming.py and TwoSideChange.py. 

## Mispriming.py
This have the source code for calculating Gibbs free energy (∆G) of primer-template complex while changing each nucleotide of primer.

## TwoSideChange.py
This have the source code for calculating Gibbs free energy (∆G) of primer-template complex while changing each nucleotide from both edges of the primer.
